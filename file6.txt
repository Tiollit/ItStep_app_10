Our Osoyoos packing facility receives fruit (including cherries, peaches, and apples) 
in bulk from Okanagan-based growers and sorts it for quality and size before packaging 
it for shipment to our domestic and international customers. Safe and efficient product 
receiving and staging, as well as keeping the production line fed are important parts 
of ensuring the quality of produce for our customers.
